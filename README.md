# Django + Infinite Scroll

Created by: Andrew Chen Wang

Created on: 28 July, 2020

Infinite scrolling using both class and function based views.

I'm tired I'm probably not gonna write too much of a README. This repo is dedicated to Donate Anything and its item display portion.

Also uses a dictionary of English words found here from another one of my testing repos, as quoted:

The dataset used is a dictionary of words by infochimps and re-made by dwyl. You can find this information here: https://github.com/dwyl/english-words

NEVERMIND ABOUT Class based. Too complicated ajax wise so whatever....
